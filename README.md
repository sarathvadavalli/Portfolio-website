# Portfolio-website
I completed this project as my 1st task in BharatIntern internship. (Web development)

Overview:

    A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase our work and let others know about ourselves. It includes our skills, achievements, projects and certifications that helps to attract the clients or employees.

This website is built using #html and #css with four fields:

ðŸ”¸'home' field consists of my name and role,

ðŸ”¸'about' field consists of basic introduction of me and this project,

ðŸ”¸'projects' field consists of list of projects I have done until now and

ðŸ”¸'contact' field consists of a form to ask any queries and my information.
